How to play Tetris:

The blocks fall at a predetermined rate which will increase as the amount of lines completed goes up. If a row is filled entirely, then the row will empty out and drop the lines above to fill the gap. Your task as the player is to keep the blocks from reaching the top by filling up lines and keeping the peak from reaching the top of the map.

Controls:

Movement: (hold to repeat)
-left:  <numpad 4> or <arrow_left>
-right: <numpad 6> or <arrow_right>
-down:  <numpad 5> or <arrow_down>

-rotate left:  <a>

Quick Place: (drops the current block all the way down)
-quick place: <space>

Pause:
-pause: <esc>
	When in pause:
	>enable round delay: <d>
	round delay gives the user a brief delay when a piece is placed; togglable for
	the faster paced players
	
	>quick restart: <r>
	restarts the game without any of the intermediary screens; for the really bad
	screw-ups

Scoring:

Scoring is calculated by: completing lines (100 * lines completed ^ 2 points), dropping the block (20 points per grid skipped), and moving down (10 points).

Note that score is all scaled by the speed multiplier, as playing with more speed is more difficult and is therefore rewarded.
